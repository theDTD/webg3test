      "question": "What's an ISBN?",
      "answer": "ISBN is the acronym for International Standard Book Number. This 10 or 13-digit number identifies a specific book, an edition of a book, or a book-like product (such as an audiobook). An ISBN can usually be found on the back cover, next to the barcode. If a book doesn't show the ISBN on the back cover, look on the page featuring the copyright and publisher information and the ISBN will be found there."
